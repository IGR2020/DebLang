# Use
In you main file or wherever you need to debug just import createEnvironment and place the required environment name and also import Debuger and use Debugger.start().
In the Debuger you can place the argument of analizeFiles which for right now records all variables.

# Note
The game.py file is not needed, it is just an example file using the DebLang.
